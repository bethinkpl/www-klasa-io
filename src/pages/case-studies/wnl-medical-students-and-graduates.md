#1 What is the reason for using the term "build" instead of "have"?

In recent times, we have had the opportunity to engage with individuals who have encountered learning difficulties. The reasons behind such challenges can be traced to various factors such as limited knowledge on effective learning techniques, undefined learning objectives, and studying subjects that we are not passionate about. At KLASA, our experience has demonstrated that these problems can be diverse and often linked to a person's lifestyle. However, a universal issue that affects many is the lack of motivation to learn.

This article serves as both a guide and a collection of experiences. Our aim is to provide a unique perspective on the concept of motivation in learning. We address this topic because motivation is often misunderstood. Most students see it as a binary concept – you either have it or you don't. This rigid viewpoint implies that motivation is something that appears out of nowhere, like a rabbit out of a hat. However, at KLASA we believe that motivation is not just something that we possess, but something that we build. This perspective allows us to consider how our learning habits impact our level of motivation, and how our learning activities can either aid or hinder our motivation-building efforts.
