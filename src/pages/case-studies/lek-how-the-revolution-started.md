Learn how Klasa helped "Więcej niż LEK" transform medical education in Poland forever, starting with their first course, "Kurs do LEK", helping students with their final medical exam.

## What is LEK and why is it important?

Lekarski Egzamin Końcowy (pol. Medical Final Exam) or simply LEK is a crucial milestone for medical students in Poland. It determines their eligibility to obtain a medical license and secure residency positions. The exam comprises 200 quiz questions from various clinical branches. The score achieved in the LEK exam directly impacts students' admission to residency programs.  

"Więcej niż LEK" is a project that was created in 2017 out of frustration with the then current educational offerings on the market. "Kurs do LEK" (LEK course) was the first e-learning solution for students and Klasa proved itself crucial for addressing their fundamental challenges.

## Fundamental learning challenges and why traditional courses failed to address them

Medical students in Poland faced several learning challenges when preparing for the LEK exam:

1. Information selection: Students struggled to find up-to-date sources to acquire the most recent medical knowledge. Medical textbooks are often out-of-date before they're even printed.
2. Planning: Organizing study materials and managing the workload effectively was a huge challenge for most people.
3. Systematizing Knowledge: Students find it difficult to structure and consolidate their medical knowledge efficiently.
4. Learning with others: It was almost impossible to regularly study with friends, as everyone had different needs and entry knowledge level.
5. Maintaining motivation: Students often struggled to stay motivated throughout the several months long exam preparation process.
Traditional, lecture-based courses have long been the predominant method of exam preparation for medical students preparing for the LEK exam. However, these courses have proven to be inefficient in addressing the core learning challenges faced by students. The passive nature of lectures often fails to engage students fully and falls short in providing the necessary tools and resources to overcome the specific obstacles encountered in LEK preparation. 

## How "Więcej niż LEK" used KLASA to solve these problems

Więcej niż LEK (WNL) was established as a solution to counter the aforementioned learning challenges. It soon became clear that existing e-learning solutions were insufficient tools to handle such a huge e-learning course. That's when KLASA came into play. It was crafted with WNL's special use case in mind, but we always cared about making our solutions universal, and not limited to these specific needs.

Synergy between WNL and KLASA resulted in a real revolution and disruption of the exam preparation market. Together, we were able to address the needs of medical students with unparalleled efficiency.

1. Information selection: Więcej niż LEK (WNL) recognized the importance of providing students with accurate and reliable content for LEK exam preparation. To ensure the highest quality of materials, WNL assembled a dedicated team of experts responsible for analyzing past LEK exams, textbooks, and also latest medical research. They carefully examined the exam structure, question patterns, and topics covered to gain valuable insights into the exam's requirements and expectations. 

	Material was meticulously organized, so that each slide contained as little information as possible. That's where atomic content really shined. Klasa, thanks to the independent and composable nature of content, allowed the team to quickly update specific information and keep the whole course up-to-date at all times in the matter of minutes.

2. Planning tools: The planning tools provided by KLASA were designed to empower students with the ability to structure their study materials, set clear goals, and track their progress throughout the exam preparation journey. KLASA's adaptive learning algorithms analyzed students' learning patterns. With the ability to categorize and arrange study materials, students could create personalized study plans matched to their individual learning needs and preferences.

	Moreover, KLASA's planning tools facilitated goal setting, enabling students to define specific milestones and objectives to achieve during their study period. By setting realistic goals, students gained a sense of direction and purpose, motivating them to stay focused and committed to their exam preparation. The progress tracking feature of KLASA's planning tools allowed students to monitor their advancement and measure their performance over time. They could visualize their learning progress, track their completion of study materials, and receive feedback on their performance.

3. Systematizing Knowledge: Więcej niż LEK aimed to achieve systematic learning and knowledge retention for their students. In response, KLASA implemented a unique approach to help them structure and consolidate their medical knowledge. One of the key features we introduced was the strategic placement of open-ended questions throughout the learning materials. These questions served as prompts for students to actively recall and apply their knowledge, fostering deeper engagement with the content.

	By presenting open-ended questions, KLASA aimed to challenge students to think critically, analyze information, and provide comprehensive answers. Our approach went beyond simple memorization, encouraging students to connect concepts, draw relationships, and synthesize information from different areas of medicine. We worked closely with WNL to ensure that the inclusion of these open-ended questions in our platform aligned with their vision of promoting a systematic and comprehensive understanding of medical knowledge among their students. 

4. Learning with others:  WNL sought to create a learning environment that struck the right balance between personalization and collaboration for their students. In response, KLASA developed solutions that facilitated both individual learning and collective knowledge sharing.

	KLASA provided a platform where students could learn individually when necessary, accessing study materials and resources tailored to their specific needs. At the same time, we created opportunities for students to engage with their peers, ask questions, seek clarification on challenging topics, and contribute their own knowledge and expertise to help others. This collaborative aspect fostered a supportive learning environment where students could benefit from the questions and insights of their fellow learners.

5. Motivation: KLASA implemented features that allowed students to track their progress, "feel" their competency, and visualize their improvement over time. The platform provided visual representations, such as progress bars that allowed students to gauge how much of the study materials they had covered. This visual feedback served as a motivating factor, as students could witness their incremental achievements and feel a sense of satisfaction as they moved closer to their goals. The supportive environment created also played a crucial role in boosting motivation. Students could interact with peers, ask questions, and receive guidance from instructors and experts. 

Additionally, WNL stands out by offering a unique satisfaction guarantee to its students. This guarantee is made possible through the precise activity tracking system implemented by KLASA. By meticulously monitoring students' progress and engagement with the course materials, WNL ensures that students can have full confidence in the effectiveness of the course.

The satisfaction guarantee provides students with assurance that their investment in the WNL program is worthwhile. If a student follows the recommended study plan, completes the assigned tasks, and actively engages with the course materials but does not achieve the desired results, WNL offers remedies such as refunds or access to supplementary resources.

KLASA was designed to address core learning challenges not only for LEK preparation but also for other medical education purposes. Its innovative approach filled the gap left by existing tools that failed to adequately address these challenges.
